What did we do?

Computational thinking,the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a solution such that it can be carried out by a computer. In order to practisce this way of thinking we made algorithms that can be applied to make a sandwich. 

Whart we learned?

We learned how to apply computational thinking by creating an algorithm to make a blueberry jam sandwhich. Applying computational thinking is a vigorous process where we have to make the instructions as straightforward as possible inorder to make it simple and understandable for the reciever of the program. 

What question do I have?

How do they turn these directions into codes that can be used by the computer?
Are the algorithmns we made applicable?
How are standard algorithms used in devices written?
Who writes those algorithms?
