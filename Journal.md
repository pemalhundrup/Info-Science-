What did we do?

Computational thinking, the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a solution such that it can be carried out by a computer. In order to practice this way of thinking, we made algorithms that can be applied to make a sandwich. 

What did we learn?

We learned how to apply computational thinking by creating an algorithm to make a blueberry jam sandwich. Applying computational thinking is a vigorous process where we have to make the instructions as straightforward as possible in order to make it simple and understandable for the receiver of the program. 

What question do I have?

How do they turn these directions into codes that can be used by the computer?
Are the algorithms we made applicable?
How are standard algorithms used in devices written?
Who writes those algorithms?
